# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this assignment was to analyze all ride share data to compare the different types of cites and it effects on fare and driver count.

Results:

The total rides for rural, suburban and urban are 125, 625 and 1625 respectively. The total fares were broken down by average fare per ride: $34.62, $30.97 and $24.52 adn for average fare per driver: $55.49, $39.50 and $16.57 for the rural, suburban and urban cities.

Summary:

The reason rural cities do not utilize PyBer could be because of the cost of more than 3 times the fare in urban and same for suburban areas that has a cost of more than 2 times the urban area. It may be beneficial to hire more suburban and rural drivers that will be in that area to cut cost. If the riders are coming from the urban area and traveling home to the suburban areas, advertising ride sharing may help cut consumers costs. The last suggestion would be to cut the fare incrementally for longer rides. This could intice more people to use Pyber for the longer hikes to the suburban and rural areas more affordable.
